# 🔍 Claude Code CLI Prompts Explorer

This project documents internal prompts discovered in the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` CLI tool (v0.2.74).

These prompts power commands such as `/compact`, `/explain`, and others in Claude Code — Anthropic's AI-powered code assistant.

This repository contains extracted prompt texts. It does **not** include any part of Claude Code’s source code.

## 📌 Why this matters

Most users interact with Claude Code through its CLI or GUI, unaware of the system prompts running behind the scenes. This repository reveals those internal messages, providing:

- Insight into how Claude handles code formatting, explanation, and editing
- Patterns in prompt engineering used by Anthropic
- Reference for developers building similar tools

> [!TIP]
> If you're working on prompt tooling or building LLM-based code assistants, studying these patterns may offer practical inspiration.

This may be useful for:
- Prompt engineers
- LLM researchers
- Open-source tool builders
