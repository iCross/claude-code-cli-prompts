# 🔍 Claude Code CLI Prompts Explorer

This project documents internal prompts discovered in the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` CLI tool (v0.2.74).

These prompts power commands such as `/compact`, `/explain`, and others in Claude Code — Anthropic's AI-powered code assistant.

This repository contains extracted prompt texts. It does **not** include any part of Claude Code’s source code.

## 📂 Available Languages

The [English version](./prompts.en.md) is the original source extracted from the CLI tool.  
All other language files are LLM-generated translations to help developers understand the prompts more easily in their native languages.  
These translations may be refined over time.

Most users interact with Claude Code through its CLI or GUI, unaware of the system prompts running behind the scenes. This repository reveals those internal messages, providing:

- Insight into how Claude handles code formatting, explanation, and editing
- Patterns in prompt engineering used by Anthropic
- Reference for developers building similar tools

> [!TIP]
> If you're working on prompt tooling or building LLM-based code assistants, studying these patterns may offer practical inspiration.

This may be useful for:
- Prompt engineers
- LLM researchers
- Open-source tool builders
